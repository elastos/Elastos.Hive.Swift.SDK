## Build from source

Use the following commands to download and build source code:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/elastos/Elastos.NET.Hive.Swift.SDK
$ cd Elastos.NET.Hive.Swift.SDK
$ pod install
$ open -a Xcode ElastosHiveSDK.xcworkspace
```

**Note:** Different versions of cocoapods will lead to compilation errors. Please keep the latest version. Use the following commands to update cocoapods

```
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

Then use the **Apple Xcode** to build ElastosHiveSDK target and generate **ElastosHiveSDK.framework**.

## Tests

### Getting started
Open the ElastosHiveSDK.xcworkspace and Select TestHost target to run unit tests. Then press **Command-6** to open the Test navigator.
There are three ways to run the tests:

1.**Product â–¸ Test** or **Command-U**. Both of these run all test classes.

2.Click the arrow button in the Test navigator.

3.Click the diamond button in the gutter.

You can alse run an individual test method by clicking its diamond, either in the Test navigator or in the gutter.

When all the tests succeed, the diamonds will turn green and show check marks.

## CocoaPods

###  Pod install
The distribution would be published to CocoaPods platform. So, the simple way to use **ElastosHiveSDK.framework** is just to add the following line to your **Podfile**:

```
$ pod 'ElastosHiveSDK'
```

Then run the command below to install it before open your Xcode workspace:
```shell
$ pod install
```

## How-to use APIs

See HOW_TO_USE_APIS(#./HOWTOUSEAPIS.md)

## Build Docs

### 1. Swift APIs Docs

Run following script command to generate swift APIs document with appledoc tool:

```shell
$ ./docs.sh
$ cd docs
```
Open index.html in the docs folder

### 2. Object-C APIs Docs

TODO.
