Elastos Hive Swift Framework
=============================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/elastos/Elastos.NET.Hive.Swift.SDK.svg?)](https://travis-ci.com/elastos/Elastos.NET.Hive.Swift.SDK)

## Summary

Elastos Hive is a basic service infrastructure that provides decentralised data storage capabilities to applications. And Elastos Hive Swift SDK provides a set of Swift APIs for applications to access/store vault data on Hive backend servers.

Elastos Hive currently is under heavy development, and plans to support with the following data objects in the near future:

- File storage
- Database
- Key-Values
- Scripting

Anyway, Elastos Hive will keep practising the promise of users remain in full control of their own data.


## Build from source

Use the following commands to download and build source code:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/elastos/Elastos.NET.Hive.Swift.SDK
$ cd Elastos.NET.Hive.Swift.SDK
$ pod install
$ open -a Xcode ElastosHiveSDK.xcworkspace
```

**Note:** Different versions of cocoapods will lead to compilation errors. Please keep the latest version. Use the following commands to update cocoapods

```
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

Then use the **Apple Xcode** to build ElastosHiveSDK target and generate **ElastosHiveSDK.framework**.

## Tests

### Getting started
Open the ElastosHiveSDK.xcworkspace and Select TestHost target to run unit tests. Then press **Command-6** to open the Test navigator.
There are three ways to run the tests:

1.**Product â–¸ Test** or **Command-U**. Both of these run all test classes.

2.Click the arrow button in the Test navigator.

3.Click the diamond button in the gutter.

You can alse run an individual test method by clicking its diamond, either in the Test navigator or in the gutter.

When all the tests succeed, the diamonds will turn green and show check marks.

## CocoaPods

###  Pod install
The distribution would be published to CocoaPods platform. So, the simple way to use **ElastosHiveSDK.framework** is just to add the following line to your **Podfile**:

```
$ pod 'ElastosHiveSDK'
```

Then run the command below to install it before open your Xcode workspace:
```shell
$ pod install
```
